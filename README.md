# Audio_transcribe_python
this script is used to do the following: 
1) change names to audio file to 1.wac,2.wav,....,n.wav (where n in the number of audio files)
2) transcribe the audio from each audio file to its approtpiate text and marking it as 1  "Text of 1.wav", 2  "Text of 2.wav", ..., n  "Text of n.wav"
3) reason behind this formatting is to use it later to comply with miscrosoft cognitive speech API to perform voice clonning
